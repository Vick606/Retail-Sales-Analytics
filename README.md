# Retail Sales Analytics: Driving Business Decisions with Data

## 1.0 Introduction

**Project Name**: Retail Sales Analytics: Driving Business Decisions with Data

In this project, I analyzed a retail sales dataset sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) to uncover actionable insights that can drive business decisions and improve profitability. The dataset contains transactional data, including customer demographics, product details, payment methods, and sales metrics. By leveraging Python and data visualization tools, I performed a comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to identify trends, customer behavior, and opportunities for growth.

This project demonstrates my ability to clean, analyze, and visualize data, as well as translate findings into actionable business recommendations.

## 2.0 Skills Demonstrated

- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and transforming data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Uncovering patterns, trends, and relationships in the data.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating insightful visualizations using `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `plotly`.
- **Business Insights**: Translating data into actionable recommendations to improve profitability.
- **Storytelling**: Presenting findings in a clear, structured, and compelling manner.

## 3.0 Tools and Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - Data Manipulation: `pandas`, `numpy`
  - Data Visualization: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`
  - Statistical Analysis: `scipy`, `statsmodels`
- **Environment**: Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub

## 4.0 Key Insights and Findings

Through this analysis, I uncovered several key insights:
1. **Sales Trends**: Identified seasonal trends and peak sales periods.
2. **Customer Behavior**: Analyzed purchasing patterns based on demographics (age, gender, location).
3. **Product Performance**: Determined top-selling products and categories.
4. **Payment Methods**: Evaluated the most popular payment methods and their impact on sales.
5. **Profitability Drivers**: Highlighted factors contributing to higher profitability and areas for improvement.

These insights were presented through visualizations such as:
- Time series plots for sales trends.
- Bar charts and pie charts for customer demographics and product performance.
- Heatmaps for correlation analysis.
